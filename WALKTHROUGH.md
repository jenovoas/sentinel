## 🔬 RESEARCH (Not Validated)

### Neural Interface Hardware
- Based on Perplexity AI search
- NOT tested by us
- Requires validation

### Other Applications
- Deep space, grids, markets
- Based on proven math
- NOT tested in those domains

## Multi-AI Methodology

**Our Innovation**:
- Use multiple AIs to find patterns
- Cross-validate findings
- Only claim what we prove

**This session**: Living proof of concept
