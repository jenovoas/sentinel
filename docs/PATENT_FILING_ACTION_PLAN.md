## 🎯 Differentiation Strategy (Claims)

### Claim 1: Telemetry Sanitization

**Prior Art:** US12130917B1 (generic prompt injection)

**Our Differentiation:**
```
PRIOR ART SCOPE:
"GenAI prompt injection classifier for user text inputs"

OUR SCOPE:
"Multi-modal telemetry sanitization for autonomous IT operations"

KEY DIFFERENCES:
1. Input type: Telemetry (logs+metrics+traces) vs user text
2. Context: AIOps automation vs GenAI chatbots
3. Sources: Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Auditd vs single text input
4. Validation: Multi-source correlation vs single classifier
5. Domain: IT operations vs conversational AI

CLAIM LANGUAGE (Narrow Scope):
"A method for securing autonomous IT operations against adversarial 
telemetry injection, comprising receiving operational telemetry data 
from a convergent observability stack comprising at least time-series 
metrics, structured logs, distributed traces, and kernel-level audit 
events..."
```

### Claim 2: Multi-Factor Decision Engine

**Prior Art:** US12248883B1 (generic malicious prompt detection)

**Our Differentiation:**
```
PRIOR ART SCOPE:
"Generative AI model prompt injection classifier"

OUR SCOPE:
"Multi-factor decision engine with Bayesian confidence scoring"

KEY DIFFERENCES:
1. Architecture: Dual guardians vs single classifier
2. Signals: 5+ independent sources vs single input
3. Scoring: Bayesian inference vs simple risk score
4. Context: Admin ops, DR mode, maintenance windows
5. Validation: Both guardians must confirm

CLAIM LANGUAGE (Emphasize Multi-Modal):
"A multi-factor decision engine for autonomous security remediation, 
comprising a telemetry aggregator configured to collect events from 
heterogeneous sources including kernel-level syscall monitors, 
application-level log aggregators, infrastructure metrics collectors, 
network traffic analyzers, and machine learning anomaly detectors..."
```

### Claim 3: Dual-Guardian Architecture

**Prior Art:** NONE FOUND ✅

**Our Unique Innovation:**
```
NO PRIOR ART:
Extensive search found no patents with "dual-guardian" or 
"mutual surveillance" architecture for autonomous systems.

OUR INNOVATION:
"Self-vigilant security system with two independent guardian 
components that monitor each other and auto-regenerate"

KEY NOVELTIES:
1. Dual guardians (Alpha + Beta) - UNIQUE
2. Mutual surveillance - UNIQUE
3. Shadow mode operation - UNIQUE
4. Auto-regeneration capability - UNIQUE
5. Impossible to compromise via single-point - STRONG CLAIM

CLAIM LANGUAGE (Broad Scope):
"A self-vigilant security system for autonomous IT operations, 
comprising a first independent guardian component configured to 
detect intrusion attempts and a second independent guardian component 
configured to validate system integrity, wherein said guardians 
monitor each other for tampering and neither can execute actions 
without central orchestrator approval..."
```
