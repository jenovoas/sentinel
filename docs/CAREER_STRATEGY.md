# 👔 Career Strategy: The "Honest Decision" (Option 1)

**Decision**: **Frontend Job (Stability)** + **Sentinel (Passion/Research)**.
**Goal**: Secure a Senior Frontend/Full-Stack role to fund the BCI vision.

## 1. The Strategy: "Funded Research"
We are not abandoning Sentinel; we are **funding it**.
Your day job provides the runway. Sentinel provides the *purpose*.

| Track | Objective | Actions |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Job (Day)** | Stability, Income, Learning Scaling | Polish Frontend, Resume, Interview Prep. |
| **Sentinel (Night/Weekend)** | BCI Research, Patent, Equity | Low-stress R&D, "Slow Burn" innovation. |

## 2. Sentinel as a Portfolio
To get the best job, Sentinel must demonstrate **Senior** capability.
We shift development focus from "Experimental Features" to **"Production Quality"**.

### A. Frontend Polish (Critical for Interviews)
Recruiters/CTOs will look at the UI first.
- [ ] **UX/UI Review**: Ensure the Dashboard looks premium (Tailwind, animations).
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Clean React patterns, strict TypeScript, Server Components.
- [ ] **Performance**: minimal CLS, fast FCP.

### B. Architecture Clarity
Demonstrate you can build scalable systems.
- [ ] **Documentation**: The current `ARCHITECTURE.md` is perfect for this.
- [ ] **Testing**: Add unit tests for critical components.

## 3. Immediate Action Plan (Career)

### Phase 1: Portfolio Readiness (Week 1)
1.  **Audit Frontend**: Review `frontend/` code for "Interview Red Flags".
2.  **Highlight Skills**: Ensure `README.md` highlights "React", "Next.js", "TypeScript", "System Design".
3.  **Deploy**: Ensure the live demo (if any) or local demo video is flawless.

### Phase 2: Application Assets (Week 2)
1.  **CV Update**: Tailor CV to emphasize "Senior Frontend Engineer" who builds "Complex Architectures".
2.  **Talking Points**: Prepare stories about *AIOpsShield* and *TruthSync* as examples of "Solving hard technical problems".

## 4. The Loop
1.  **Work**: 9-5 Frontend React.
2.  **Earn**: $$$.
3.  **Invest**: Buy BCI hardware (OpenBCI/Muse), Server gear.
4.  **Build**: Advance Sentinel Cortex on your own terms, without starving.
