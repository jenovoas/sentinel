- Team: $400K (3 engineers)
- Marketing: $400K
- Runway: $950K (18 months)

### Series A ($5-10M)
- Phase 3 (Cognitive): $500K
- Team: $2M (scale to 15)
- Sales + Marketing: $2.5M
- Runway: $2-4M (24 months)

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
- **Rust complexity**: LOW (you know it)
- **ML accuracy**: MEDIUM (human oversight)
- **Integration**: MEDIUM (extensive testing)
- **Performance**: LOW (load testing)

### Business Risks
- **Market timing**: LOW (Phase 1 differentiates)
- **Competition**: MEDIUM (first-mover advantage)
- **Funding**: CRITICAL (need seed round)

### Mitigation
- Incremental delivery
- Customer pilots
- Extensive testing
- Sustainable pace
