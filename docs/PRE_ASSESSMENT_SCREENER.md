- Proficiency in Docker, Git, Python, TypeScript
- Active open source contributions

We encourage you to:
- Set up a proper development environment
- Contribute to open source projects

Best of luck in your search.

- Time wasted: 60+ hours

**After Pre-Screener**:
- 100 applicants → 15 pass pre-screen → 10 phone screens → 5 assessments → 2 hires
- Time saved: 40+ hours
- Better hire quality: 2x

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Be Ruthless
If they can't answer these basic questions, they're not engineers. Period.

### 2. Don't Make Exceptions
"But they have 10 years of experience!" → Doesn't matter if they use Windows without WSL2.

### 3. Trust the Data
GitHub activity doesn't lie. Empty profile = not a real engineer.

### 4. Move Fast
- Send pre-screener: 2 minutes
- Review response: 30 seconds
- Decision: Instant
- Total time per candidate: < 3 minutes

### 5. No Sympathy
"I'm learning Docker" → Great! Apply again when you know it.
"I can set up Linux if you hire me" → No. Set it up BEFORE applying.

## 🎓 What You're Really Testing

This pre-screener tests:

3. **Honesty**: Can they actually do what their resume claims?
4. **Initiative**: Did they set up their dev environment without being told?
5. **Seriousness**: Are they serious about engineering or just job hunting?
