## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Risk Distribution
- **CRITICAL**: 13 workflows (0.5%) - Hardcoded credentials
- **HIGH**: 1,508 workflows (54.4%) - Code execution/SSH
- **MEDIUM**: 26 workflows (0.9%) - Insecure HTTP
- **LOW**: 1,225 workflows (44.2%) - Safe to evaluate

---

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS

### DO NOT USE (Without Manual Review)
- ❌ All 13 CRITICAL workflows
- ❌ All 1,508 HIGH workflows  
- ⚠️ 26 MEDIUM workflows

### SAFE TO EVALUATE (1,225 LOW)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ No code execution
- ✅ No SSH/FTP access

---

## 🎯 Sentinel Integration Strategy

**Phase 1**: Manual review of 1,225 LOW-risk workflows
**Phase 2**: Adapt (remove credentials, validate URLs)
**Phase 3**: Integrate with ITIL + RIG pipeline

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

**Before using ANY workflow**:
1. Manual code review
2. Test in isolated environment
3. Replace credentials
4. Validate URLs
5. Enable audit logging

**Red Flags**:
- 🚩 Hardcoded API keys
- 🚩 Code execution nodes
- 🚩 SSH/FTP connections
- 🚩 Shortened URLs
- 🚩 HTTP (non-HTTPS)
