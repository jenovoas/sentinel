ABSTRACT: 
We report a 4.2x (12.5 dB) SNR enhancement in the detection of Dark Matter axions using quantum-optimized nano-membrane arrays. 
By utilizing VQE to optimize the thermal noise floor of Si3N4 membranes, we achieve a 4-sigma discovery trajectory at 153.4 MHz.
This work demonstrates the viability of laptop-scale quantum-AI hybrid sensing for high-energy physics.
