ABSTRACT: 
We propose a scalable "Digital Haloscope" architecture for the high-sensitivity search of QCD axion dark matter candidates. 
Utilizing high-fidelity numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a distributed array of 1000 nano-mechanical membranes, enhanced by VQE-optimized noise squeezing, can theoretically achieve a 20.0 dB reduction in spectral noise density below the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). 
Our model projects a statistical significance of up to 10.2-Sigma for target signals at 153.4 MHz. 
This work provides a reproducible computational template for next-generation quantum sensing platforms, highlighting the potential for AI-driven active cooling and massively parallel sensor networks to bypass traditional cryogenic constraints.
COMMENTS: 15 pages, 6 figures. Numerical simulation study.
