# TruthSync Hybrid Buffer Implementation

## Phase 1: Prototype (Current)
- [/] Setup Rust dependencies
- [ ] Implement shared memory buffer (Rust)
- [ ] Create Python wrapper
- [ ] Test basic communication
- [ ] Benchmark buffer overhead

## Phase 2: Optimized Processing
- [ ] Implement Aho-Corasick
- [ ] Add batch processing
- [ ] Parallel processing
- [ ] End-to-end benchmark

## Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Measure final speedup
- [ ] Stress testing
- [ ] Update viability analysis
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Buffer overhead < 5μs
- [ ] Total speedup > 50x
- [ ] Throughput > 500k docs/sec
