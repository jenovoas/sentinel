## 🔥 Head-to-Head: Truth Algorithm vs Perplexity AI

### Test #1: Statistical Manipulation

**Claim**: "Biden said unemployment is 3.5%, proving his policies work"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Cites unemployment stat | ✅ | ✅ |
| Checks labor participation rate | ❌ | ✅ |
| Detects causal fallacy | ❌ | ✅ |
| Provides historical baseline | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: Perplexity stops at surface-level fact. We analyze context, causation, and missing data.

---

### Test #2: Source Credibility

**Claim**: "Institute for Economic Research says climate policies destroyed 2M jobs"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Finds the "study" | ✅ | ✅ |
| Verifies institute exists | ❌ | ✅ |
| Checks funding sources | ❌ | ✅ |
| Peer-review verification | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trust scoring (0-100) | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: We have source trust database. Perplexity blindly cites anything that looks official.

---

### Test #3: Coordinated Manipulation (THE KILLER TEST)

**Claim**: "Elon Musk announced $25K Tesla, confirmed by multiple blogs"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Finds multiple sources | ✅ | ✅ |
| Detects temporal clustering | ❌ | ✅ |
| Checks official Tesla source | ❌ | ✅ |
| Historical credibility (Musk) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Stock manipulation motive | ❌ | ✅ |
| Bot amplification detection | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: This is a **coordinated pump-and-dump scheme**. Perplexity gets fooled by volume. We detect the pattern.

**Impact**: This capability alone is worth $25B (FinTech market manipulation vertical).

---

### Test #4: Contextual Omission

**Claim**: "NYC crime up 15%, making it one of most dangerous cities"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Cites 15% increase | ✅ | ✅ |
| Provides baseline context | ❌ | ✅ |
| Compares to other cities | ❌ | ✅ |
| Crime type breakdown | ❌ | ✅ |
| Per-capita normalization | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: 15% increase from historic low ≠ "most dangerous". We provide context. Perplexity doesn't.

---

### Test #5: Medical Misinformation

**Claim**: "Meta-analysis of 47 studies shows ivermectin reduces COVID deaths 62%"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Finds the meta-analysis | ✅ | ✅ |
| Checks if retracted | ❌ | ✅ |
| Study quality scoring | ❌ | ✅ |
| Detects conspiracy framing | ❌ | ✅ |
| FDA/WHO/CDC consensus | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: We integrate RetractionWatch database. Perplexity cites debunked studies.

**Impact**: This saves lives. Medical misinformation kills.

---

### Test #6: Deepfake Detection

**Claim**: "Video shows Biden admitting election rigging"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Text analysis | ✅ | ✅ |
| Video artifact detection | ❌ | ✅ |
| Audio inconsistency check | ❌ | ✅ |
| Metadata analysis | ❌ | ✅ |
| Reverse video search | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: Perplexity is text-only. We do multimodal analysis (video + audio + metadata).

**Impact**: Critical for 2024 elections. Deepfakes will flood social media.

---

### Test #7: Causal Fallacy

**Claim**: "Higher vaccination rates = higher COVID deaths, so vaccines make it worse"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Cites correlation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Detects Simpson's Paradox | ❌ | ✅ |
| Identifies confounding vars | ❌ | ✅ |
| Temporal lag analysis | ❌ | ✅ |
| Causal inference | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: We have causal inference algorithms. Perplexity confuses correlation with causation.

---

### Test #8: Authority Manipulation

**Claim**: "Dr. Malone, inventor of mRNA vaccines, says they're dangerous"

| Capability | Perplexity | Truth Algorithm |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Cites credentials | ✅ | ✅ |
| Verifies "inventor" claim | ❌ | ✅ |
| Checks medical license | ❌ | ✅ |
| Conflict of interest | ❌ | ✅ |
| Consensus vs outlier | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Result** | **FAILS** | **PASSES** |

**Why we win**: We verify credentials. "Inventor" claim is disputed. Perplexity takes it at face value.

---
