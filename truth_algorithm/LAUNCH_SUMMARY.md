## 🔥 THE 8 TEST CASES (Our Weapon)

1. **Statistical Manipulation** - Detects missing context
2. **Source Credibility** - Verifies fake institutes
3. **Coordinated Manipulation** - **KILLER TEST** - Detects pump-and-dump
4. **Contextual Omission** - Provides baseline/comparison
5. **Medical Misinformation** - Checks retraction databases
6. **Deepfake Detection** - Multimodal analysis
7. **Causal Fallacy** - Correlation ≠ causation
8. **Authority Manipulation** - Verifies credentials

**Each test = A $20-50B market vertical**
