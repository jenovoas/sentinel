# Research - Future Investigations

**Status**: SPECULATIVE - Not yet validated  
**Purpose**: Exploration and hypothesis testing

---

## What's Here

This directory contains:
- Theoretical concepts
- Untested hypotheses
- Exploratory implementations
- Philosophical discussions

**None of this is production-ready.**

---

## Proven vs Speculative

### ✅ PROVEN (in `/quantum_control/`)
- OptomechanicalCooling physics model
- BufferResource, ThreadResource, MemoryResource
- QuantumController
- 13/13 tests passing
- n=1000 statistical validation

### 🔬 RESEARCH (in `/research/`)
- Cosmic patterns analysis
- Philosophical implications
- Future applications (grid, traffic, economy)
- Advanced physics models (parametric, coherent)

---

## How to Use This

1. **Read with skepticism**: These are ideas, not facts
2. **Validate before using**: Test thoroughly
3. **Contribute**: Add your own research
4. **Promote when proven**: Move to production when validated

---

## Contributing

To move research to production:

1. Implement the concept
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Run statistical validation (n≥1000)
4. Document thoroughly
5. Submit PR with evidence

**Evidence required**:
- Working code
- Passing tests
- Statistical significance (p < 0.05)
- Technical documentation

---

**Remember**: Speculation is valuable for exploration, but only proven code goes to production.
