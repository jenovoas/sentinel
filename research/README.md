# Research Directory - Status Guide

**What goes here**: Everything we haven't tested ourselves.

---

## ✅ PROVEN BY US (`/quantum_control/`)

**Tested with n=10,000**:
- Network buffers (BufferResource)
- Thread pools (ThreadPoolResource)
- Memory heaps (MemoryResource)
- OptomechanicalCooling physics
- 7.67% improvement, 1M+ drops prevented

**Evidence**: Our benchmarks, our tests, our code

## 🔬 RESEARCH (`/research/`)

### Has Scientific Precedent (Not Tested By Us)

**Neural Interface**:
- Bone conduction: ✅ Published, clinically used
- Closed-loop control: ✅ FDA-approved devices
- Quantum sensors: ✅ Research-grade operational
- **Our status**: Need to test with our algorithm

**Deep Space**:
- Orbital mechanics: ✅ Well understood
- Buffer optimization: ✅ We proved it works
- Mars communication: ✅ NASA has data
- **Our status**: Need NASA partnership for validation

### Pure Hypothesis (No Direct Precedent)

**Power Grids**:
- Control theory: ✅ Established
- Our algorithm: ✅ Proven for buffers
- Grid application: ❓ Untested
- **Our status**: Need utility partnership

**Financial Markets**:
- Circuit breakers: ✅ Exist
- Our algorithm: ✅ Proven
- Market application: ❓ Untested
- **Our status**: Need exchange partnership

## The Rule

**If WE haven't run the benchmark → `/research/`**

Even if:
- Others have proven similar concepts
- Scientific precedent exists
- Theory is sound

**Only OUR validated results go to `/quantum_control/`**

## Current Status

**Production** (`/quantum_control/`):
- 3 resources tested ✅
- n=10,000 validation ✅
- 13/13 tests passing ✅

**Research** (`/research/`):
- Neural interface (has precedent)
- Deep space (has precedent)
- Power grids (hypothesis)
- Financial markets (hypothesis)
- Urban traffic (hypothesis)
- Everything else
