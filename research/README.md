# Research Directory - Status Guide

**What goes here**: Everything we haven't tested ourselves.

---

## 🎯 Research Scope

**Our Goal**: Bridge current academic research with Sentinel architecture

**NOT doing**: Original academic research  
**ARE doing**: Integration research

**Method**:
1. Find current academic research (via Perplexity, etc.)
2. Adapt to Sentinel's proven architecture
3. Test and validate integration
4. Document findings

**Example**: Neural interface
- Academic research: Bone conduction, aDBS, OPMs (existing)
- Our contribution: Apply to Sentinel's quantum control framework
- Integration: Adapt OptomechanicalCooling to neural signals
- Validation: Test algorithms (n=1,000) ✅

## ✅ VALIDATED BY US (`/quantum_control/`)

**What we actually tested**:
- Network buffers (n=10,000)
- Thread pools (n=10,000)
- Memory heaps (n=10,000)
- 7.67% improvement proven
- 6 mathematical theorems proven

**Evidence**: Our benchmarks, our tests, our code

## 🔬 RESEARCH (`/research/`)

**Everything here is research, NOT validated by us.**

### Based on Multi-AI Pattern Detection
- Gemini: Implementation & math
- Perplexity: Academic search
- Cross-validation: Pattern matching

**NOT official peer-reviewed validation**

### Neural Interface
- Hardware: Research findings (Perplexity)
- Algorithms: Tested by us (n=1,000)
- Integration: NOT tested

### Other Applications
- Deep space, grids, markets, etc.
- Based on proven math
- NOT tested in those domains

## The Rule

**If WE tested it → `/quantum_control/`**  
**If we found it via AI → `/research/`**  
**If it's a hypothesis → `/research/`**

**Only claim what we prove.**
