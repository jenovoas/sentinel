# Research Notes - Cosmic Patterns
## Personal Investigation Guide

**Purpose**: This directory contains exploratory research and pattern analysis conducted with AI assistance (Google Gemini). These are investigation guides and hypotheses for future validation, not peer-reviewed findings.

**Status**: 🔬 Research Phase - Requires Experimental Validation

---

## Contents

- `LA_GRAN_CONVERGENCIA.md` - Analysis of isomorphic patterns across quantum physics, biology, and cybernetics
  - Optomechanical levitation ↔ Sentinel feedback loops
  - Neurobiological vibration ↔ Haptic interfaces
  - AIOpsDoom analysis ↔ Dual-Guardian architecture
  - Temporal encoding (SNNs) ↔ Log timing

---

## Usage

These documents serve as:
1. **Investigation roadmap** for future experiments
2. **Hypothesis generation** for academic research
3. **Pattern recognition** across disciplines
4. **Personal study notes** with AI assistance

**Not for**:
- Patent applications (use validated claims only)
- Academic papers (requires experimental validation)
- Public presentations (needs peer review)

---

## Next Steps

1. Design controlled experiments
2. Collect empirical data
3. Statistical validation
4. Peer review
5. Publication
