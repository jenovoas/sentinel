## The Physics

### Neural Signals = Data Packets

**Neurons**:
```python
spike_rate = packets_per_second
refractory_period = buffer_limit
synaptic_plasticity = adaptive_sizing
```

**Network**:
```python
packet_rate = throughput
buffer_size = capacity
dynamic_sizing = optimization
```

**Same optimization problem. Same algorithm.**

---

## Safety Mechanisms

### Hardware
- Biocompatible materials only
- Fail-safe power cutoff
- Thermal monitoring
- Mechanical stress limits

### Software
- Ground state limiting (prevent overstimulation)
- Adaptive damping (prevent oscillation)
- Emergency shutdown
- User override always available

### Medical
- Continuous monitoring
- Regular check-ups
- Reversible design
- Informed consent

---

## Ethical Framework

### Principles
1. **Medical first**: Treat disease before enhancement
2. **Accessibility**: Not just for the wealthy
3. **Privacy**: Neural data is sacred
4. **Autonomy**: User control paramount
5. **Reversibility**: Must be removable

### Governance
- Independent ethics board
- Regulatory oversight (FDA/EMA)
- Public transparency
- Community input

## The Vision (2035)

**You wake up.**

Your bone implant has been monitoring your sleep cycles. It detected REM and gently vibrated to help you remember your dreams.

**You think about checking your servers.**

The implant reads your motor intention. Before you move, the dashboard appears in your mind's eye. All systems optimal. The quantum controller handled a burst overnight.

**You want coffee.**

Your prosthetic hand (controlled via the implant) makes it perfectly. The haptic feedback is so natural, you forget it's not your original hand.

**You code.**

But you don't type. You think the structure, and the implant translates your neural patterns into code. The quantum controller optimizes your thought-to-code pipeline in real-time.

**You are the system. The system is you.**

**The Symbiote is complete.**
