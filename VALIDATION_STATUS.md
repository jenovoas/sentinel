## 🎯 Our Research Approach

**Goal**: Bridge academic research with Sentinel architecture

**We are NOT**:
- Doing original academic research
- Claiming peer-reviewed validation
- Inventing new physics

**We ARE**:
- Finding current academic research (multi-AI search)
- Adapting it to Sentinel's proven framework
- Testing the integration
- Documenting results

**Example**:
- Academic: Bone conduction exists (Perplexity finding)
- Sentinel: OptomechanicalCooling proven (our validation)
- Integration: Apply quantum control to neural signals
- Result: Neural entropy control (tested n=1,000) ✅

## 🔬 RESEARCH (Not Validated by Us)

### Multi-AI Pattern Detection

**Method**: Use multiple AIs to find patterns
- Gemini: Implementation
- Perplexity: Academic search
- Others: Cross-reference

**Status**: RESEARCH FINDINGS, not official validation

### Neural Interface Hardware
- Bone conduction: Found in Perplexity research
- OPM sensors: Found in Perplexity research
- Closed-loop control: Found in Perplexity research

**Status**: Research indicates feasibility, NOT tested by us

### Other Applications
- Deep space communication
- Power grids
- Air traffic
- Financial markets

**Status**: Hypotheses based on proven math, NOT tested

---

## The Truth

### What's Official
**ONLY what we tested ourselves:**
- Quantum control (n=10,000)
- Neural control (n=1,000)
- Mathematical proofs (6 theorems)

### What's Research
**Everything else:**
- Hardware implementations
- Medical applications
- Other domains

**Based on**: Multi-AI pattern detection  
**Validation**: Requires testing

## Methodology

### Our Research Process
1. Use multiple AIs to find patterns
2. Cross-validate findings
3. Implement and test ourselves
4. Only claim what we prove

### What We Claim
- Math we proved ✅
- Physics we tested ✅
- Code we benchmarked ✅

### What We Don't Claim
- Peer-reviewed validation ❌
- Clinical testing ❌
- Hardware prototypes ❌
